#' @title Predict contact rate between age groups across all settings
#' 
#' @description Predicts the expected contact rate across all settings ("home",
#'   "school", "work", and "other") over specified age breaks, 
#'  given some model of contact rate and population age structure. Optionally 
#'  performs an adjustment for per capita household size. See "details" for more
#'  information.
#'    
#' @details The population data is used to determine age range to predict 
#'   contact rates, and removes ages with zero population, so we do not 
#'   make predictions for ages with zero populations. Contact rates are 
#'   predicted yearly between the age groups, using [predict_contacts_1y()], 
#'   then aggregates these predicted contacts using 
#'   [aggregate_predicted_contacts()], which aggregates the predictions back to 
#'   the same resolution as the data, appropriately weighting the contact rate 
#'   by the population. Predictions are converted to matrix format using
#'   [predictions_to_matrix()] to produce contact matrices for all age groups
#'   combinations across different settings or location of contact.
#'   
#'   We use Per-capita household size instead of mean household size.
#'     Per-capita household size is different to mean household size, as the 
#'     household size averaged over **people** in the population, not over 
#'     households, so larger households get upweighted. It is calculated by 
#'     taking a distribution of the number of households of each size in a 
#'     population, multiplying the size by the household by the household count 
#'     to get the number of people with that size of household, and computing 
#'     the population-weighted average of household sizes. We use per-capita 
#'     household size as it is a more accurate reflection of the average 
#'     number of household members a person in the population can have contact 
#'     with.
#' 
#' @param population a dataframe of age population information, with columns 
#'    indicating some lower age limit, and population, (e.g., [get_polymod_population()])
#' @param contact_model A list of GAM models for each setting. See example
#'   output from `fit_setting_contact` below
#' @param age_breaks A vector of age breaks.
#' @param per_capita_household_size Optional (defaults to NULL). When set, it 
#'   adjusts the household contact matrix by some per capita household size. 
#'   To set it, provide a single number, the per capita household size. More
#'   information is provided below in Details. See 
#'   [get_per_capita_household_size()] function for a helper for Australian
#'    data with a workflow on how to get this number.
#' @param model_per_capita_household_size modelled per capita household size.
#'     Default values for this are from 
#'     [get_polymod_per_capita_household_size()], which ends up being 3.248971
#'
#'     
#' @return List of contact rate of matrices for each setting: ("home", "work",
#'   "school", "other").
